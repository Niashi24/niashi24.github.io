          Releasing: End of 2023 <br>
          Untitled Saturn RPG is a turn-based rpg featuring minigames where you dodge enemy attacks with one of three controllable characters.
          Think of it as a cross between the 'Mario & Luigi' RPG series and 'WarioWare: Get It Together!' with the visual identity of a certain Sega Saturn game.<br>
          You'll control three different characters: 
          <span style="color: #c65197">Arial</span> the Spider, <span style="color: #cf573c">Ryder</span> the Wolf, and <span style="color: #73bed3">Shriek</span> the Bat!
          <br><br>---Story---<br>
          Arial is a shy spider who has trouble expressing her feelings to the rest of the party. She was recruited by Shriek due to her useful web abilities.<br><br>
          Ryder is the self-proclaimed leader of the group. You can count on him to hype up the party during a tough encounter.<br><br>
          Shriek is a somewhat bossy bat who always has her eyes focused on her next goal. She joins the group to have someone watch her back when searching for treasures.<br><br>
          This novice team decided to adventure inside a nearby mountain to search for treasure.
          Soon after entering though, the cave floor crumbles and the team falls through, separating the trio.
          Will these three be able to find each other in the depths below and find their way out, and maybe even learn a little about what it means to be a team?
          <br><br>---Gameplay---<br>
          Battles are divided into turn-based and action segments. Select a move and perform a short button minigame which will determine its effectiveness.
          Plan your attacks accordingly to take out the enemies efficienty.
          When enemies attack, the battle shifts into an action segment.
          Depending on who was attacked, you control one of three characters to complete a minigame that determines how much damage you take.
          Skillful players may be able to avoid taking any damage at all!
          <br><br>
          Arial can use her web to swing and pull on objects. Hold Right Click/Right Bumper to shoot out a web in a direction until it hits a wall or object.
          Arial can pull on her web with Left Click/Left Bumper, pulling her and the object towards each other.
          She can also swing on an object (or have an object swing on her!) by holding Shift/Left Trigger.
          <br><br>
          Ryder can do a charge jump with Right Click/Right Bumper to cross large distances, and can charge a bark attack with Left Click/Left Bumper to move around objects.
          Finally, he can hold shift on the ground to start a run.
          <br><br>
          
          Shriek can flap her wings with Left Click/Left Bumper and can stay in the air indefinitely.
          She can charge a sonic shriek attack with Right Click/Right Bumper which allows her to move objects.
          She can stay still in the air using Shift/Left Trigger at the cost of moving much slower.
